100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 14: August 9, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Needed to check the Twilio logs, not just the AWS Logs. I was using the wrong variable. Started to gather data for Old Town Road ML

**Thoughts**: This was a good reminder of needing to check ALL logs when using multiple services (Twilio + Zappa + AWS). 

**Tomorrow's To-Do**: gather data for Old Town Road ML ( lyrics/artists/genre/album cover/bpm/mp3) 

**Future To-Do**: Old Town Road ML (build basic model + add more data + apply to DataCamp) + $5 lawyer

### Day 13: August 8, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Set up Twilio/Zappa/AWS, just need to figure out why the webhook/twilio# isn't responding

**Thoughts**: Configuration sucks. I don't like doing it. For the last 2 week's I've been afraid to tackle these unknown configuration issues. Brave not perfect.

**Tomorrow's To-Do**: figure out zappa webhook url + start on Old Town Road ML (gather lyrics/artists/genre/album cover for 10 songs) 

**Future To-Do**: Old Town Road ML (build basic model + add more data + apply to DataCamp) + Blindness ML (maybe) + scheduler or $5 lawyer

### Day 11: July 22, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Emailed Twilio about Flask Sessions on AWS Lambda

**Thoughts**: Wonder if I can simply copy paste the twilio python code, or if I need to find another way to read the previous texts

**Link to Work**:

**Tomorrow's To-Do**: import python helper libraries + copy code to awslambda

**Future To-Do**: Old Town Road ML + Blindness ML + scheduler/eats/food


### Day 9: July 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Created a simple AWS Lambda function for Twilio

**Thoughts**: Wonder if I can simply copy paste the twilio python code, or if I need to find another way to read the previous texts

**Link to Work**:

**Tomorrow's To-Do**: import python helper libraries + copy code to awslambda

**Future To-Do**: Old Town Road ML + Blindness ML + scheduler/eats/food
