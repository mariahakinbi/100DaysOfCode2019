100 Days Of Code - Log

#Day 9: July 18, 2019
##Today's Progress: Created a simple AWS Lambda function for Twilio
##Thoughts: Wonder if I can simply copy paste the twilio python code, or if I need to find another way to read the previous texts
##Link to Work:
##Tomorrow's To-Do: import python helper libraries + copy code to awslambda
##Future To-Do: Old Town Road ML + Blindness ML + scheduler/eats/food
